Howdy! I am Grant Dickinson, and I'm currently a second year chemistry major at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I do not have a specific career goal within the field of chemistry, but research and synthesis are some of my present interests. However I am open to new experinces to expand my interests. As of today, I am in a research group run by Dr. Frantz here at Cal Poly, studying the synthesis of highly strained molecules and their synthesis.  

### More Information

I am from Monrovia, California which is a small town about five minutes away from Pasadena, which is where the Rose Parade takes place annually. Monrovia is also where the headquarters for Trader Joe's is, and is the only reason some people know Monrovia exists. In high school I played Soccer, Basketball, and Baseball. Some of my interests outside of chemistry include sports, mostly football and basketball, video games and just being a nerd in general. Eventually, in a career post chemistry, I hope to possibly start my own gaming company and start designing games of my own. I also enjoy baking, mostly because of my insane craving for sweets.
