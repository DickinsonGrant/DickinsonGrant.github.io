Howdy! I am Grant Dickinson, and I'm currently a second year chemistry major at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I do not have a specific career goal within the field of chemistry, but research and synthesis are some of my present interests. However I am open to new experinces to expand my interests. Right now I am in the process of joining a research group, which will broaden my horizons in chemistry.
